# Loan-Amount-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
A simple machine learning project that predicts the loan amount based on applicant details such as income, loan term, and credit history. The project uses Python, pandas, and scikit-learn to preprocess data, train a Linear Regression model, evaluate its performance, and save it for reuse.
# Loan Amount Prediction

This project aims to predict the loan amount that will be sanctioned based on various applicant and loan-related features. The solution leverages machine learning techniques to build a predictive model using a dataset containing loan application details.

## Project Overview

Loan amount prediction is an essential task for financial institutions to estimate the loan amount eligible for applicants based on their profile. This project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building to predict loan amounts accurately.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on loan applicants, including:

- Applicant's income and co-applicant income
- Loan amount and loan term
- Credit history
- Property area
- Education, gender, marital status, and employment status

The dataset is typically sourced from a CSV file (`train.csv` or `loan_data.csv`) and contains both numerical and categorical features.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features where necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Visualizing distributions, relationships, and correlations between features and the loan amount.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.

4. **Model Building**  
   Training regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost to predict loan amounts.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluating models using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination).

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BhavinAghera/Loan-Amount-Prediction.git
   cd Loan-Amount-Prediction
